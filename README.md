<h1>Welcome to the Django Starter Kit repository! ðŸš€</h1>

<h2>Hello Everyone!ðŸ™Œ I am Shaikh Asfak.</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository serves as a starting point for anyone looking to kickstart their Django web development journey.
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, my goal is to provide you with a solid foundation to build Django web applications quickly and efficiently.
In this repo you will see multiple projects of Django that you can implement to inhance your skills.
Note that i will push new projects and update existing projects time to time.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<b>To get started with this Django Starter Kit, follow these simple steps:</b>
<p>
    1. Download the Code from Repo. After opening the folder , You will find 
      		<ol type="A">
            <li>Project folder same name as root folder.</li>
      		  <li>App folder.</li>
      		  <li>manage.py file etc.</li>
          </ol>
  2. Now for output you need to run server for that write this command in 'Terminal or CMD'.(python manage.py runserver)<br>
  3. After that you will see path that you need to write in any 'Browser'.<br>
  4. Yay! Here you go!!<br>
  5. For admin site access('write-your-localhost-address/admin/' in your browser).<br>
  6. You will require to provide 'username' and 'password' to log-in.<br>
  7. [A : 'admin' may be used for both 'username' and 'password'] OR Go to Option 'B'.<br>
     [B : For setting your own username and password write this command in 'Terminal or CMD'.(python manage.py createsuperuser) ,<br>
  		you will be ask for username , email-address , password then super user will be created successfully.]<br>
  8. After log-in , In admin site , You can see 'models' where you can see, add, change and delete objects through admin site.<br>
  9. You will be see already stored objects there , those were added by me.<br>
  10. Remember for more deep understanding of django , you need to learn the basics first like <br>
      (views.py, settings.py, urls.py, admin.py, models.py, and for html,css,javascript directories be like templates and static even commands for migrations to add models and all.)
